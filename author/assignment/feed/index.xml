<p>If you want to reach more people online, maybe you’ve done a bit of research into SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). SEO is the process of making your site more visible on Google and other search engines.</p>



<p>The idea of being found by droves of potential clients for free is very alluring and SEO is indeed a fantastic way to get clients. But it’s a vast and technical subject and a source of much frustration for people. To be perfectly honest, you can get quickly overwhelmed by all the articles and advice online. It’s hard to know what advice is reliable and relevant to your needs!</p>



<p>In this article, I introduce a way of getting leads and clients online with SEO without getting too bogged down.</p>



<h1>Don’t Google it! Not yet…</h1>



<p>When you want to optimise your site for search engines, the best place to start is OFFLINE!! Whaaaat? Yep, my advice is to start your SEO project with the human beings you wish to serve rather than technical tools and fiddly strategies.</p>



<h2>STEP 1: Start with humans</h2>



<ul><li>Who are your potential leads and clients?</li><li>What questions do they have?</li><li>What words do they use to search for answers to their questions?</li></ul>



<p>Ask 5 people who you could describe as your “ideal client” about how they talk about and research their problem.</p>



<p>I specify&nbsp;<em>Starting with humans</em>&nbsp;because you can easily slip down the rabbit hole of hacks, tips and strategies to “trick” Google into listing you top of the search results pages. When you start with the people you wish to serve, you’ll know the words they use when they Google their questions. Keep note of this information. You’ll need it later to create content that resonates with them.</p>



<h1>Get the SEO Explainer Series</h1>

<h1>It’s not all about knowing the latest algorithm</h1>



<p>Unless you’re becoming an SEO expert, you’re not obliged to know all the criteria and requirements for being well ranked on Google. It’s more about understanding Google’s role than trying to trick the (very smart) Google bots.</p>



<h2>STEP 2: Understand what Google is</h2>



<p>Google wants to provide the best and most relevant links for the terms searched. Best and most relevant… what does that mean really?</p>



<h3>Best?</h3>



<p>Your site should be well structured, easy to navigate and fast-loading. If your site is “good” in Google’s eyes it meets these standards. It also gives your site visitor a good experience which means they’re more likely to stick around! Win-win!</p>



<h3>Relevant?</h3>



<p>If your site is up to date with fresh content it will be seen as relevant by Google. If your site gets a lot of traffic, social shares and links from other reputable sites Google will see it as a well-respected site and is more likely to rank it higher in the search results pages.</p>



<p>How closely do the words match up? Is the vocabulary on your site matching the terms that people search? (See Step 1). When your site’s content matches what people are searching, you’ll be ranked higher because your content is relevant. This is the starting point of understanding keywords and phrases.&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchi.mp/7d20b6776c20/seo-video-series">Learn more in my free training here.</a></p>



<h1>Showing up on search results pages is half the battle</h1>



<p>When your site, or specific page of your site is ranked high on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) you’re doing great! The next challenge is to get people to click through to your site.</p>



<p>STEP 3: Get the click</p>



<p>The top results on SERPs are usually ads and well known websites. If your site is listed among them your task is to get people to choose your listing and not the others. This is called “Click Through”. Showing up in the results is not going to get you any clients, but getting a higher click through rate means that your site is getting traffic and traffic means more eyeballs on your offering.</p>



<p><em>Write a good title and description</em></p>



<p>You can define how each page of your site shows up on SERPs. It’s a little copywriting exercise that can be made easier if you really understand what your potential site visitor is looking for.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-rounded"><img src="https://clairecreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/How-to-increase-your-cick-trough-rate-on-serps.png" alt="" class="wp-image-33488" title=""/></figure>



<p>The meta title is the bright blue text in the SERP’s listing. Use it to catch people’s attention.</p>



<p>The meta description is your opportunity to ‘tease’ the content of that page. Use this space to help the reader decide to click.</p>



<h2>Add this to your website’s pages</h2>



<p>If you’re site runs on WordPress you can use the&nbsp;<em>Yoast</em>&nbsp;plugin to take control of how your site’s pages and posts are listed.</p>



<p>If you’re using Squarespace, Wix or Weebly, each page and post has an SEO tab where you can tailor how your site appears.</p>

<p>So you’re ready to invest in your website.</p>



<p>You’re looking for a designer or developer to work with.</p>



<p>You want to get a website that actually acts as a valuable business tool and you want to launch on time and on budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Best thing to so is to prepare everything your developer will need so that there’s no time lost in emailing over and back, and no uncertainty about what needs to be created.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of things you need to prepare.</p>



<h1>5 things your web developer will ask you:</h1>



<h2>1. What have you got set up already?</h2>



<p>If you have an existing site or multiple sites, your developer will want to know about them. Maybe you’ve been registering domain names from various providers, or maybe you’ve bought hosting and other services and you’re not sure how to use them.</p>



<p>Instead of adding additional paid services unnecessarily your developer can help you make use of the tools you’ve already paid for or make suggestions on where to get a better deal. They know about this stuff.</p>



<p><em><strong>TASK 1</strong>: Create a document detailing what domain names and hosting you’ve signed up for. And if you can, make note of any tools and systems that have been set up there.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>2. Do you have your login information?</h2>



<p>Have your login information ready to send, BUT only send it when you’ve officially got the project started. This means agreeing to the scope of work’ and having some written commitment that you’ve both signed. Even if this person has come recommended from a friend, it’s really useful to get some sort of agreement or contract written up for security and accountability purposes and so that there’s no confusion later on. Once it’s all official, you can send your site and online account logins over in a secure way.</p>



<p>If you don’t have that information to hand, your developer may be able to help you sort it out, but let them know up front. If they can’t access your online accounts, there can be a fiddly and annoying delay, before you even get started.</p>



<p><em><strong>TASK 2</strong>: Gather the login information and agree with your developer on their preferred method to receive this kind of secure information.</em></p>



<h2>3. Do you have an existing brand?</h2>



<p>Do you have any branded material, style guides or mood boards to help your developer to understand what you want?</p>



<p>In some cases your developer will have a system in place to help you get your design references together, but not always. If you have a brand developed already make sure you gather all the highest quality files together in one place, ready to send over as a pack.</p>



<p>If you don’t have an existing brand you need to talk to your developer about the style of your site in greater detail.&nbsp;You can’t take for granted that the person making your site will do brand development too. Branding is a project in itself. Some developers will be able to help you get your visual style together, but you can’t assume that that is the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>TASK 3</strong>: Create a file with all your brand elements and design references.</em></p>



<h2>4. What is the purpose of the site?</h2>



<p>A website is a business tool. It needs to have a clearly defined role and should fit into a broader strategy that supports your business. Some developers understand how to set up marketing strategies, and others will focus much more on the technical functionality of the site istelf.&nbsp; Take some time to consider the real purpose of your site. When you have a clear plan, your developer will be able to implement faster and you’ll get a website that serves a real purpose in your business.</p>



<p><em><strong>Task 4:</strong>&nbsp;Figure out how your website will serve your business and outline a plan for your developer to refer to for context.</em></p>



<h2>5. Will you be supplying content?</h2>



<p>Find out if they need all the content in advance. Many developers will need you to send over documents and images before they get started while some developers will gather images for you and get copy prepared. With all of the points in this article, it depends on how your developer prefers to work and the actual budget of the whole project.</p>



<p>If you have to provide text and images, make sure you have an effective way to collaborate. Sending dozens of emails can be a bit confusing for both of you! Find out their preference. How do they want to recieve the content. I recommend using an online cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive so that you can add to it and send extra stuff without things getting lost in spam filters or overlooked.</p>



<p><em><strong>Task 5</strong></em><em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Set up a system to send files and collaborate throughout your project.</em></p>



<h1>Still confused by the whole thing?</h1>



<p>If you’re getting into a new website build or a revamp I’d be happy to offer you some guidance. I offer a free chat.&nbsp;<a href="https://clairecreative.com/book-now">Want to grab one?</a></p>



<p>I work one on one with my clients so that they don’t have to figure out technical stuff or the strategy. I help people to use their website to get leads and clients online. I’ve lost count of how many conversations I’ve had with people who had a bad experience with their developer, lost money or ended up with a website they hate! It doesn’t have to be like that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a looming launch date or you’re fed up of trying to figure everything out by yourself. Let’s get on a call.</p>



<p>Chat soon 🙂</p>

<p>The mistake I made that cost me subscribers</p>

<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to dramatically improve your visibility by talking to 5 people..." width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ui3eSzVJYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Creating a content plan helps me to stay (more or less) consistent with my online&nbsp;visibility. I like to base that plan on what people are actually interested in. So, earlier this month, I reached out to my list and invited people to come for a chat and to tell me more about what they struggle with in terms of websites and getting leads online.</p>



<h2>I spoke with 5 people.</h2>



<p>Why 5? Interviewing 5 people gives you enough insight to see&nbsp;patterns, but not so much information that you get bogged down and lost in ideas and data. (Ref:&nbsp;<em>Sprint</em>&nbsp;by Jake Knapp)</p>



<p>Listening to them, I noticed the same issues and questions came up again and again. It was easy to make a list of topics for my content plan. But, something even more valuable came out of these interviews. I was reminded of something very important. I have to examine and challenge my assumptions.</p>



<p>When you’re self-employed, a freelancer, or a ‘company of one’ you often work alone. You have to make all the decisions, set goals, create plans, build websites, launch campaigns. It’s all based on what you feel is right, based on how you want to be seen, what you want to be known for. But…planning is guessing unless you examine your assumptions.</p>



<h2>My assumption:</h2>



<p>Last summer I created a really detailed handbook that contains my entire process and approach to getting leads and clients online. I spent weeks on it, added all my biggest learnings from books I’d read, courses I had taken, the mentorship I had received! I was so excited to share it with people.</p>



<p>But after a few weeks, I noticed that it wasn’t getting signups. So I pushed the promotion&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more. But nope. My list-building free handbook that was SO valuable was totally missing the mark.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>My assumption was that the greater the value, the more signups I’d get. Conducting a few interviews, it became&nbsp;abundantly clear that it was just too MUCH!</p>



<h2>Ebooks are dead&nbsp;(for MY ideal client)</h2>



<p>How many times have you downloaded a 20+ page PDF and never read it? I do it too! I always file the thing away with the intention of getting back to it, but then never do!!!</p>



<p>My ideal client knows this about themselves. They know that it’s probably something that they’d LIKE to read, but probably won’t. Chatting with them reminded me of this and allowed me to create something that is much more aligned with them.</p>



<p>When we reconnect with the people we want to serve, they LITERALLY tell you what you need to do to reach them and people like them. And it’s free!</p>



<p>When you know how to reach them, you know what content to write, where to position yourself, what channels to show up on, what to offer! So go talk to your subscribers and create a plan of action!</p>

<h2>Staying on top of lead generation can be a real challenge when you’re really busy with projects. Juggling multiple projects and clients in a “work feast” moment in your business can mean that a “work famine” is right around the corner.</h2>



<p>If you pride yourself on doing good work but you are&nbsp;<strong>prone to over-promising and bending over backward to ensure a happy client</strong>&nbsp;you’re on your way to becoming overstretched and time-poor. And this is a sure-fire way to have repeating work feast and famine cycles and frustratingly inconsistent income. If that sounds like you, please read on.</p>



<h2>Serving your clients well but protecting your time.</h2>



<p>Let’s look at how you can set expectations and boundaries so that you can serve your clients well and still have time to attract new leads.</p>



<h3>Communications</h3>



<p>For me,&nbsp;<strong>I avoid replying to emails and doing client work out of office hours.</strong>&nbsp;In the early days, I was almost always available and reacted as quickly as possible to requests and enquiries. Even in the evenings, at weekends and on holidays! My schedule was all over the place and lead generation was always the first thing to suffer. When I began to stick to proper office hours, and structured my days more consciously, I was able to serve my clients and find time for marketing. This sounds really basic, but it’s incredibly effective.</p>



<p>Be sure to&nbsp;<strong>have a clear rule on communication with your existing clients</strong>&nbsp;so that you’re not jumping between social, email, and Whatsapp. If clients are using multiple platforms to reach you your workflow will be a mess. Simply let your clients know the best way to communicate with you. For me it’s email and I even write this into my contracts now. Nobody seems to mind and it means I have a central place for conversations and feedback.</p>



<h3>Expectations</h3>



<p>Make sure your clients know what to expect from the project itself (eg: sign an agreement with a scope of work). This is a big one! Again, in the early days, I would get stuck into a project as quickly as possible to show my enthusiasm, but I neglected to let my clients know how much would be involved in the project. This led to people asking for more bits and bobs that would add more time, led to missed deadlines and a tonne of stress and frustration. My being 100% flexible was bad for everyone involved.&nbsp;<strong>When you have a ‘scope of work’ or project outline that you both agree to it means you can stay on track, have a better basis for communication and have a lot less wasted time.</strong></p>



<p>Protecting&nbsp; your time and sticking to deadlines means that projects are less likely to run over and you can make space in every week for lead generation. Literally put it in your calendar. When you have no time left to work on getting leads you’ll find yourself with no leads in the pipeline. It’s a scary moment when there’s nothing coming in and this often means you’ll be tempted to offer discounts, take unsuitable jobs, and get flippin’ stressed out about income.</p>



<p>But it’s not just about finding time…</p>



<h2>Are you showing up enough to make an impact?</h2>



<p>There are potential clients out there in need of your help, part of your job as a service provider is to show up for them. Having a good looking website and meaningful social media posts is great for business, but&nbsp;<strong>are you spending more time planning and editing and playing with nice designs than you are making real connections?</strong></p>



<p>Managing your online presence can he very time consuming, but I’d like to move away from simply managing time better, and&nbsp;talk about connecting with people who would become clients in a meaningful, memorable way.</p>



<p>It’s normal to feel a bit shy, or reluctant to really get out there on social media. When we feel insecure about showing up online we tend to fiddle and tweak and ‘perfect’&nbsp;how things look.&nbsp;It’s easy to get into a rut of busy work saying things like “As soon as I get my brand redone I’ll start sharing more on Instagram”. “As soon as I get this new microphone and ring light I’ll start doing Facebook Live”.</p>



<p>Look, I totally get it! But “As soon as…” usually means that you’re procrastinating and that means you’re losing weeks (if not longer) and missing out on getting new clients. People who need your service need to know you’re out there. If you’re offering something they need they probably won’t give a toss if your Instagram grid is fabulous or not! So don’t waste time trying to get things looking perfect before showing up, just get out there so that the people who need you know about you.</p>



<p><a href="https://clairecreative.com/habit-stunting-business-growth/">RELATED: Is “as soon as” holding you back?</a></p>



<p>If you find yourself doing and redoing things on your site and social feeds maybe it’s time to get more structured in your plan of action and get clear on what you should be doing daily to show up online. Here are a few things to do to get you started.</p>



<h2>Zoom out then zoom back in</h2>



<p>I talk a lot about having a “lead generating machine” for your business. It’s different for every-single-business! I use these 3 questions with my own clients when we’re designing their ‘machine’ (website + strategy) so that we end up with an incredibly powerful system for getting clients.</p>



<ul><li>What’s working to bring you leads already? (Explore how and why this is working so that we can replicate it.)</li><li>What are you spending time on that actually makes no difference to your bottom line? (Time is your most valuable asset, let’s not waste it on stuff that doesn’t work.)</li><li>If you’ve got a plan of action and you dutifully implement it, what is the weak point where you lose leads? (Look at the path that clients take to hire you – where are people dropping out?)</li></ul>



<p>So there you have it. Free up time by keeping your projects on track. Don’t wait until everything is “perfect” to get visible and get clear on what you need to do so that you’re not wasting time on things that don’t work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two people fall in love. But is their experience real? Or is it just an effect of the medicine they&#8217;re taking?</p>



<p>Kate looked around the room at the other people: ten men and ten women all around the same age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Thank you for coming today and offering your time to help with our research! Limeren, the medicine we&#8217;re testing, is in the final stage of testing. Previous human trials have shown us that Limeren is completely safe &#8230;&#8217;</p>



<p>Kate stopped paying attention. She&#8217;d read the information the medical research company had sent her, so she knew that Limeren had already been approved for sale and that they were not testing to see if there were side effects. She didn&#8217;t know any of the other people in the group. She guessed that none of them had jobs either or they wouldn&#8217;t be earning money by testing medicine. But otherwise&nbsp;it was impossible to know if she had anything in common with any of them. She hoped so, or four days in the research centre would feel like a very long time.</p>



<p>&#8216;&#8230; as side effects, we know that some people experience stronger emotions and a feeling of general happiness,&#8217; the head researcher said. &#8216;We&#8217;ll be interviewing each of you and doing tests during the day and night. So if you can all sign the forms, we can start.&#8217;</p>



<p>Kate signed her form without reading the information. Hopefully, this was going to be a very easy way to make money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;I hope the food&#8217;s better than last time,&#8217; said the guy sitting next to her as he gave in his form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kate smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m Michael.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Kate,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Have you been here before?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;I do these trials as often as they&#8217;ll let me!&#8217; He laughed. &#8216;It&#8217;s such an easy way to make money!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She smiled back. Here was someone she had something in common with.</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>A few hours later, Kate was eating dinner. She had taken her second Limeren tablet before dinner. She was feeling really relaxed. Maybe it was the vitamins, or maybe it was just because she had so much free time and there was nothing she needed to do. There were books to read, films to watch and even board games and puzzles. At home, she had to send out job applications. Or she had to go to stressful job interviews. After more than twenty applications she still didn&#8217;t have a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She looked up and saw Michael smiling at her. &#8216;Do you want to play a board game?&#8217; he asked. His eyes were really dark brown, Kate thought. She hadn&#8217;t noticed that earlier. She felt her cheeks go red. &#8216;Sure,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;But I like to win,&#8217; she warned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Perfect,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Me too!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Was it her imagination or did his cheeks look a bit pink too?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>For the next two days, Kate and Michael spent hours and hours playing games, chatting and watching films.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;I feel as if I&#8217;ve known you for months, not days,&#8217; she said. She already knew he lived nearby, that he was a student&nbsp;studying for his PhD and that he had dimples in his cheeks when he smiled and a cute way of putting a pen behind his ear when he was reading. She wasn&#8217;t sure, but she thought he was trying to sit next to her for meals and spend time with her whenever he could. Or maybe she was the one who was always looking for him.</p>



<p>&#8216;So, do you think you&#8217;re feeling any side effects?&#8217; he asked her one evening. They were sitting on the sofa, watching a film. Michael&#8217;s knee was almost touching her leg, and if his hand moved just a little, it would be touching hers. Her heart beat faster and all she could think about was being near enough for his skin to touch hers. Her face was red again, she knew it.</p>



<p>&#8216;Any what?&#8217; she asked, trying to concentrate on their conversation instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;The side effects of Limeren that they told us about at the presentation,&#8217; he said, moving his hand away. Her skin immediately felt cold, as if his hand had been making the air between them warm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Oh, I wasn&#8217;t really listening,&#8217; she said. &#8216;We still get paid anyway, don&#8217;t we?&#8217;</p>



<p>And then he did it. He moved his hand so that it covered hers. A nice feeling travelled all the way through her fingers and across her skin. She turned her hand over and held his hand. He smiled and moved his face towards hers.</p>



<p>&#8216;Can everyone come and get their next Limeren, please?&#8217; called a nurse. Michael dropped her hand and followed the rest of the group to the nurse&#8217;s room. Kate couldn&#8217;t remember ever feeling so happy.</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8216;Thank you everyone for taking part. You&#8217;re now free to go,&#8217; the head researcher said&nbsp;the next morning as the trial ended. &#8216;Any side effects will disappear over the next few days. If you have felt any strong feelings, and happiness, those feelings will decrease. Fortunately, we don&#8217;t expect anyone to become depressed. However, we will keep in touch with all of you in the next few days to make sure everything is fine.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;We can have our first date now,&#8217; Michael said to Kate. &#8216;Breakfast?&#8217;</p>



<p>Over breakfast, they talked and talked. Kate knew she was in love. It was stupid, but it was true. Michael said it first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t believe I met you. I&#8217;ve never felt like this about anyone before.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;This does feel amazing,&#8217; Kate said. But she had been worried about something since the beginning of the trial. She hadn&#8217;t wanted to think about it but now she had to ask him a serious question.</p>



<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t think …?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;What?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;What if it&#8217;s the Limeren making us feel like this? What was it he said about strong feelings?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s only one way to find out!&#8217; he said. &#8216;If you don&#8217;t want to be my girlfriend any more after a few days, we&#8217;ll know it was just the Limeren.&#8217;</p>



<p>She smiled at the word &#8216;girlfriend.&#8217; &#8216;Maybe your side effects will go away first!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Maybe!&#8217; He laughed. &#8216;But I don&#8217;t think so. This feels real to me.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;Me too,&#8217; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<h3><strong>Four months later</strong></h3>



<p>A few months later, Kate was thinking about the beginning of their relationship. She had to admit, nothing could ever be as perfect as those first days together. Real life had to start again. She got a job a few days after the trial ended. Michael went back to the library and his books and research projects. She didn&#8217;t have to worry about money any more but they could no longer spend all day, every day together. They were no longer at that exciting stage of falling in love. But&nbsp;they saw each other when they could and they met each other&#8217;s&nbsp;parents. Everyone expected them to get married. When he finally asked her to marry him, she felt that old excitement again.</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<h3><strong>Three years later</strong></h3>



<p>&#8216;I really don&#8217;t have time for this!&#8217; Kate shouted. She hated doing the weekly shopping.&nbsp;Why couldn&#8217;t he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Fine, I&#8217;ll go then,&#8217; she said, closing the door hard so that it made a loud noise.</p>



<p>Kate felt as if these kinds of arguments were happening more often. As she walked around the supermarket, she thought about how they&#8217;d been before, when they were in love. &#8216;Can it ever feel like that again?&#8217; she wondered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walking into the health section, she recognised a word on a box of medicine. Limeren. The vitamin&#8217;s name reminded her of a special time, a time when she was really crazy about Michael. She picked up a box and put it in her basket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>When she got home, Michael was already in bed so she ate dinner alone, taking her Limeren with a big glass of water. The next morning, she woke up early as usual, but instead of jumping straight in the shower, she joined Michael downstairs for breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Good morning!&#8217; she said. To her surprise, she suddenly wanted to kiss him on the cheek. So she did, and sat down next to him at the table. He was eating in front of a big pile of books, looking cute with a pen behind his ear. &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m applying for money for my next research project,&#8217; he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Oh, good luck! What&#8217;s the project about?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After breakfast, she thought how nice it had been to see him talking about something he cared about. She&#8217;d forgotten how cute his dimples were when he smiled, she thought. Or maybe she hadn&#8217;t seen him smile much recently. Anyway, she decided to have breakfast with him every day, since it had been such a lovely start to the day. It couldn&#8217;t hurt to make a bit more effort, could it?</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<h3><strong>Two years later</strong></h3>



<p>The baby hadn&#8217;t stopped crying for two hours, but now her little face was peaceful as she slept. Kate felt annoyed. Where was Michael? She went downstairs and found him filling bottles with milk for the baby.</p>



<p>&#8216;Well done!&#8217; Michael said. &#8216;That didn&#8217;t sound easy.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;No!&#8217; she said angrily. &#8216;It isn&#8217;t!&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re doing an amazing job,&#8217; he said. &#8216;OK, so, I&#8217;ve washed all the clothes, made your lunch for later and I&#8217;m going to come home early this afternoon so that you can have some time for yourself.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kate managed to smile and say thank you. He really was being very sweet, even if she was too tired to feel grateful or to be nice back. As soon as he had left for work, she picked up the box of Limeren. By the time he came home, Kate felt able to smile back when he smiled at her.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>One year later</strong></h3>



<p>Kate was putting clothes away while the baby slept. She picked up one of Michael&#8217;s favourite jumpers and held the soft material next to her cheek. She missed him and he had only been out an hour. Putting it back, she noticed something hard under the rest of the jumpers in the drawer. It was boxes and boxes of Limeren.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They weren&#8217;t hers! She was shocked to see these boxes. She took Limeren every day, it was true, but Michael? She thought of Limeren as an easy way to those feelings she&#8217;d always had for Michael. And it was working. Every day she felt madly in love with her wonderful husband. Everyone said marriage was hard work, but she just didn&#8217;t have time or energy for the job of marriage as well as her part-time job and a young baby. When she took Limeren, she made more effort to do small things that made their life together enjoyable. If he did something nice for her, she said thank you, but most of all she actually felt grateful. If he wore a new shirt or his hair looked good, she told him he was handsome. She asked him about his day and remembered things that were important to him. She&#8217;d seen nothing wrong with doing this. Until now, that is. Now she knew why he had always been so good at doing those same things for her. It was all fake!</p>



<p>Instead of smiling at Michael when he got home, she was angry. Clearly the Limeren only had a limited ability to make everything perfect because nothing felt perfect right now.</p>



<p>&#8216;What are all these?&#8217; she asked. She pointed to the Limeren packets she&#8217;d taken from the drawer and put on the kitchen table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael moved closer and tried to read the small writing on the boxes. &#8216;They&#8217;re vitamins, aren&#8217;t they?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t act as if you&#8217;ve got no idea why I&#8217;m asking!&#8217; said Kate, even more angry. &#8216;These boxes,&#8217; she said, picking one of the packets up, &#8216;are our relationship.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; he said.&nbsp;&#8216;It&#8217;s Limeren!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;Yes, it&#8217;s Limeren,&#8217; she said. &#8216;I know exactly what they are.&#8217;</p>



<p>He looked confused. &#8216;So why are you asking me what they are? I remember the name now you&#8217;ve said – from the place we met, right? – but I&#8217;ve not taken those for years.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;What?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;I just &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s better to get vitamins from fruit and vegetables, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; he said. &#8216;The research company sent us boxes and boxes of them years ago, but I put them away somewhere and forgot to throw them away. We eat a healthy enough diet so there&#8217;s no need to take vitamins.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;What about &#8230;&#8217; She felt her voice getting louder and louder, but also something made her feel less sure about the words she planned to say. Her idea sounded stupid. &#8216;What about the falling in love part? The side effects! You&#8217;re always so wonderful, the perfect husband. And now I know why!&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;Er &#8230; thanks?&#8217; He laughed. &#8216;I know they told us there were some side effects, but we were just joking when we said we fell in love because of the medicine, weren&#8217;t we? Also,&#8217; he added, turning the box over in his hands,&nbsp;&#8216;they must have changed the ingredients or something because it doesn&#8217;t say anything on the box about side effects. See?&#8217; He held it out for her to look. &#8216;Maybe they changed the recipe after we did that trial. Who knows?&#8217;</p>



<p>He gave her a big hug. &#8216;This perfect husband is all natural, don&#8217;t worry.&#8217;</p>



<p>He went upstairs to kiss the baby and then she heard him in the kitchen as he started to make dinner. She looked carefully at the boxes and it was true. There was nothing on the box about side effects, or even on the information inside. They were just vitamins after all. Limeren wasn&#8217;t an easy way to love and it never had been.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’ve been told how useful and valuable video can be for your business.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Almost every social platform encourages you to use it by making it as easy as possible to “go live” or upload a video.</li><li>YouTube is the biggest search engine on the web after Google Search.</li><li>Viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, compared to 10% when reading it in text!&nbsp;(Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://biteable.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://biteable.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics/)</a></li></ul>



<p>Using video for your business is easier and more effective than ever. But actually making the thing, is a lot harder.</p>



<p>I started making videos for my business in 2017. I get the full-body cringe if I have to rewatch those early live streams and ‘tutorial’ posts. They were far from perfect, but even in their wonky, imperfect form, these videos helped me to get clients online. They helped people to find me, get a sense of how I work and even simply to remember my name.</p>



<p>There are a bunch of things that I struggle with, each and every time I do a video for my business. In this article, I’m sharing the top 3 (even though I could probably list about 50!!!)&nbsp;</p>



<h2>1. My appearance</h2>



<p>Maybe my hair looks weird, or I look too tired, or it’s just one of those days when I look my age +15 more years. I struggle to make a video when&nbsp;<em>…the-head-on-ya, Claire</em>&nbsp;is my first reaction to my face on the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How do I get past this?</h3>



<p>I remember – people don’t really care what I look like! I’m not an influencer. I’m not selling skincare products. Looking fancy&nbsp;is not the point of the video. The point of the video is to&nbsp;bring value to my audience. I show up on video because it helps people in my audience to understand something about their website or web strategy.</p>



<p>So here I go… eye-bags ‘n all.</p>



<h2>2. Content</h2>



<p>Is anybody going to understand what I’m trying to say? Are they even interested in this?</p>



<p>Classic impostor syndrome here. I’m always worried that my content isn’t good enough or interesting enough or that it doesn’t make sense. And there are so many resources online, why should someone listen to my take?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How do I get past this?</h3>



<p>I remind myself of my ideal client and how she consumes content online. I remember to make a video on a topic that she has potentially ‘Googled’ recently. I break down my information in a way that looks at this topic from her specific point of view. I make videos (and blogs) that are designed to be helpful to her and suddenly, it all gets that much easier.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Distribution</h2>



<p>Uch this is the worst one. I alway struggle to distribute the videos that I’ve made. My usual process looks a bit like this</p>



<ul><li>I’ll get asked a question by a client or potential client</li><li>I’ll explore the topic in greater detail and draft some notes</li><li>I’ll record a video (using Zoom) or I’ll go live on one of my social platforms.&nbsp;</li><li>I’ll upload the video to YouTube and then embed it on my website and create a blog post around it (just like this one).</li><li>Then I’ll share it on my social media channels and send it out to my mailing list.</li></ul>



<p>What I neglect to do though is to re-share it. Things move fast online, sharing the same piece of content a bunch of times is fine. It means that someone in your audience has a greater chance of seeing it. While I KNOW this, I get reluctant about re-sharing. I’m actually not sure why!</p>



<h3>How do I get past this?</h3>



<p>I remind myself… If they don’t wanna watch it, they won’t watch it, it’s fine. And if they do watch it for a second or third time, that’s actually great.</p>



<p>Another reason re-sharing is good. I sometimes get really busy and don’t have time to make something new. To keep showing up, I’ll repurpose an older piece (and silently cringe) but at least I’m showing up repeating myself, it’s better than not showing up at all.</p>



<h2>Publish over perfection.</h2>



<p>I think it’s clear from my example that you can decide for yourself what your video style is. If you can make a super-slick, super professional video every week, go for it! But it if comes down to it, just showing up with something your ideal client will get value from is enough. It doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to be valuable and specifically for them.</p>
